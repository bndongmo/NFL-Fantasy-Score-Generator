# NFL-Fantasy-Score-Generator
Welcome to this Jupyter Notebook, where we embark on an exciting journey to delve into the fascinating world of sports analytics. Our objective is twofold: first, we aim to fit fantasy score distributions to gamma distributions, which will allow us to gain valuable insights into the underlying statistical properties of fantasy sports data. Second, we'll challenge the existing correlation matrices that exist between different positions, with the aim of uncovering potential hidden patterns and relationships.

Fantasy sports have rapidly gained popularity among sports enthusiasts, offering a unique and engaging way to interact with various sports leagues. In fantasy sports, participants create imaginary teams comprising real players, and their performances in actual games contribute to the team's fantasy score. This score is determined by a set of rules that assign points for specific actions, such as scoring goals, making assists, blocking shots, or making successful passes, depending on the sport.

To effectively strategize in fantasy sports, it's crucial to understand the statistical distribution of fantasy scores for players and the relationship between players from different positions. Traditionally, the Normal distribution has been a popular choice to model player performances. However, recent research suggests that fitting gamma distributions might provide a more accurate representation of fantasy score data. This Notebook will explore the merits of employing gamma distributions to model fantasy score data, revealing insights into player performance variability and the impact of outlier performances.

Furthermore, we'll tackle the challenge of understanding the correlation matrices between different positions in various sports. Analyzing these positional correlations can unlock valuable information for fantasy sports managers and analysts, enabling them to make well-informed decisions while drafting players and constructing optimal lineups. We'll investigate whether traditional positional dependencies still hold or if there are emerging trends that could reshape strategic thinking in fantasy sports.

Throughout this Notebook, we'll leverage powerful data analysis tools, visualizations, and statistical techniques to uncover the hidden gems within the vast ocean of sports data. We encourage you to interact with the code, analyze the results, and draw your own conclusions from our findings.

So, let's begin our adventure into the world of sports analytics, where data-driven insights and exploration await us! Strap on your analytical seatbelts and get ready to unearth the secrets behind fantasy score distributions and positional correlations in the enthralling realm of sports.
